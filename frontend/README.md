# Passle Sync - Settings Page

Made using Create React App and the WordPress REST API.

## Notes

- `node_modules/react-scripts/scripts/build.js` has been modified to allow non-production builds.

- Run `npm run watch` to watch for js changes and rebuild the frontend.

## TODO

- Add a WordPress section to the client module for CMS Integrations
- Sort out API keys
- Support multiple passles
- Pagination
- Tidy up code structure?
- Typescript? Webpack directly?
