# Passle Sync - Settings Page

Made using Create React App and the WordPress REST API.

## Notes

- `node_modules/react-scripts/scripts/build.js` has been modified to allow non-production builds.

- Run `npm run watch` to watch for js changes and rebuild the frontend.

## TODO

- Tidy up code structure?
- Typescript? Webpack directly?
- Flag if the sync's failed - allow it to stop
- Key error
- Note permalink type required for API
